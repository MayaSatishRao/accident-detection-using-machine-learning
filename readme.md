# Accident Detection using Machine Learning

VGG16 pretrained model is used to detect accident. It consists of 16 CNN layers. The dataset used for training is: Accident Detection From CCTV Footage from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ckay16/accident-detection-from-cctv-footage). Opencv is used to convert video to frames. To add Accident detected frame to accidentImages MongoDB database, gridFS is used. To alert the emergency services when an accident is detected, Internet calling is used. This is implemented using Twilio. Register a mobile number in Twilio. Update the Account SID, API Key, Twilio phone number, Registered phone number in keys.py file.
